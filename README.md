# ðŸ›« Flight Reservation App

This is a simple desktop app I built using Python and Tkinter. It lets you book, view, edit, and delete flight reservations â€” everything is saved locally using SQLite. It's lightweight, easy to use, and doesnâ€™t require any fancy setup.

## ðŸŽ¯ What It Does

- **Book Flights** â€“ Fill in passenger info, flight number, date, destination, seat, etc.
- **View Reservations** â€“ See all saved flights in one place
- **Edit or Delete** â€“ Make changes or remove bookings anytime
- **Save Everything** â€“ All data is stored in a local `.db` file so it sticks around after closing the app
